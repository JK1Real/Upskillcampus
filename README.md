# Prediction of Agriculture Crop Production in India

This project aims to predict crop production in India using machine learning techniques. The predictive model developed in this project can help farmers and policymakers make informed decisions about crop planning and resource allocation.

## Steps
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model training and evaluation
- Crop production prediction

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data on crop production in different regions of India, including information about crop types, agricultural practices, and environmental factors.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
To run the notebook locally, ensure that you have Python and jupyter notebook installed on your system along with the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install the dependencies using the following command:
